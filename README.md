Mouldit is about creating Enterprise ready CRUD applications without wasting time on repetitive coding. Like this repo if that sounds like something you would want to have! 
To realise this, Mouldit will come with a CLI, that will lead you through setting up your backend, your frontend and sync both so everything just works out-of-the-box!
