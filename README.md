<h1>Mouldit</h1>
<p>Mouldit strives to make it easier and faster to create enterprise ready CRUD applications. It does this with the help of a CLI, which let's you setup all necessary rest API's together with the UI that need to interact with them. The configuration path you follow through the use of the CLI will make it possible to get as custom as you need, not only regarding the API's but regarding the frontend of your app as well. At the same time for every configuration, default behaviour is built-in as to limit the specifications you need to do.
