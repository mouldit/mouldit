Mouldit is about creating Enterprise ready CRUD applications without wasting time on repetitive coding. Like this repo if that sounds like something you would want to have! 
To realise this, Mouldit will come with a CLI, that will lead you through setting up your backend, your frontend and sync both so everything just works out-of-the-box! 
<h1>How Mouldit will achieve the task</h1>
<p>When building your schema it will infer all possible, meaningfull crud actions a random user would need. It won't just be basic CRUD operations, but also more advanced ones like adding or removing a concept from a list like property. For every action you will be able to tell Mouldit how you would want the UI to facilitate this action, by picking the correct frontend components and their default behavior. </p>
