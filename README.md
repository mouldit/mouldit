<h1>Mouldit</h1>
<p>Mouldit strives to make creating enterprise ready CRUD applications easier and faster at the same time. It does this with the help of a CLI, which let's you setup all necessary rest API's together with the UI that needs to interact with them. The configuration path you follow through this CLI will make it possible to get as custom as you need, not only regarding your rest API's but regarding the frontend of your app as well. At the same time for every configuration, default behaviour is built-in as to limit the specifications you need to make.
