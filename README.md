<h1>Mouldit</h1>
<p>Mouldit strives to make creating enterprise ready CRUD applications easier and faster at the same time. It does this with the help of a CLI, which let's you setup all necessary rest API's together with the UI that needs to interact with them. The configuration path you follow through this CLI will make it possible to get as custom as you need, not only regarding your rest API's but regarding the frontend of your app as well. At the same time for every configuration, default behaviour is built-in as to limit the specifications you need to make.
 </p>
<h2>Gradual approach</h2>
<p>Although the goal is to make the CLI so that you don't need to add any custom code after the initial setup, this will only be achieved gradually. As Mouldit grows the amount of actions will get bigger as well as the level of detail to which you can configure these actions. What the frontend concerns, there it will be the amount of UI components and their details.</p>
